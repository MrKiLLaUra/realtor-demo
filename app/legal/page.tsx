          <p>
            This site, &ldquo;{DEMO.brand}&rdquo;, is a portfolio demonstration created by <StudioLink /> to
            illustrate the design and functionality of a property website. It is not a real estate agency, is not
            licensed or regulated as one, and does not provide property, financial, legal or any other professional
            services.
          </p>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Fictional content">
          <p>
            All listings, photographs, prices, descriptions, locations, reference numbers, people, names, reviews and
            contact details shown here are fictional or illustrative. Any resemblance to a real property, person,
            business or address is coincidental. Property imagery is licensed stock photography used for illustration
            only and does not depict the places described.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mortgage calculator and any figures, statistics or &ldquo;reviews&rdquo; are illustrative examples and
            must not be relied upon for any decision.

        <Section title="Contact actions are disabled">
          <p>
            Calling, emailing, WhatsApp and the enquiry forms are intentionally non-functional. The phone number and
            email address are placeholders that do not connect to anyone, and submitting a form sends and stores
            nothing. No message you enter reaches any real person.

            By accessing or using this website you agree to these terms. The site is provided for demonstration and
            evaluation purposes only. You may browse it and view its design freely, but you must not misuse it — for
            example, by attempting to disrupt it, access it other than through the interface provided, or use it to
            represent that {DEMO.brand} is a real, operating business.

            This demo is designed to collect as little as possible. It does not use tracking or advertising cookies,

            <strong>Retention.</strong> This data persists only in your browser and only until you clear it. You can
